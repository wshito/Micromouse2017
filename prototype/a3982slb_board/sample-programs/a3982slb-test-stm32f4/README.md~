# stm32f4_cmsis_template

This is a CMSIS project template for STM32F4 microcontroller to develop on GNU ARM Eclipse.  The HAL dependency is removed.

### Usage

1. Download the ZIP archive and rename the directory to the new project name.
1. Import the project as existing eclipse project.  The project name will be stm32f4_cmsis_template at this point.
2. Rename the project name using the refactoring menu.

The template contains the simple blinky example in `src/main.c` for STM32F4-Discovery board.  Building project will make both hex and elf files.
